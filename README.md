# Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Numpy

This repository is a collection of different machine learning algorithms implemented in Python using only the Numpy library (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc...). I followed multiple problem sets from the online Machine Learning course at Stanford University (CS229, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). The problem instructions and source data can be found within the project folders. 

## What's Included

### Problem Set 1
Problem 1b - Logistic Regression Classifier using Newton's Method
Problem 1e - GDA (Gaussian Discriminant Analysis) classifier

Problem 2 - Logistic Regression with partial data labels

Problem 3- Poisson Regression

Problem 5b - Locally Weighted Linear Regression
Problem 5c - Locally weighted linear regression implemented with various hyperparamter (tau) values

### Problem Set 2
Problem 5 - Create a kernelized version of the perceptron model. Both a dot-product kernel and a radial basis function (rbf) kernel are trained

Problem 6 - Spam classification using Naive Baye's algorithm and a support vector machine (SVM)

### Problem Set 3
Problem 4- Semi-supervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Problem 5 - Image compression using K-means clustering
