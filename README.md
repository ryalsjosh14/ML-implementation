# Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Numpy

This repository is a collection of different machine learning algorithms implemented in Python using only the Numpy library (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc...). I followed multiple problem sets from the online Machine Learning course at Stanford University (CS229, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). The problem instructions and source data can be found within the project folders. 

## What's Included

### Problem Set 1
Problem 1b - Logistic Regression Classifier using Newton's Method

Problem 1e - GDA (Gaussian Discriminant Analysis) classifier
